I started off with the heuristics behind the method (Bayesian inference if you are curious) and continued into some of the more detailed advantages and disadvantages behind why I would choose this method. I think they were a bit surprised about this as my original background is in economics, which is traditionally a domain that employs frequentist based methodologies. This led the interviewers to asking, “It seems you are quite familiar with Bayesian statistics and given your background, how did you come to using Bayesian methods within your projects?”. To which I responded, “I first read about the concept in Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and became deeply intrigued, so I read a few textbooks about Bayesian statistics and Bayesian methods in machine learning.” The interviewers responses, “You read textbooks?”.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">No Code, Dependency, and Building Technology</title><link href="https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/2021/08/10/No-Code-Dependency-and-Building-Technology.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="No Code, Dependency, and Building Technology" /><published>2021-08-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-08-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/2021/08/10/No-Code-Dependency-and-Building-Technology</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modernity and Abstraction]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Probabilistic Prediction Problems - Part 1</title><link href="https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/probability/2021/05/31/Probabilistic-Predicion-Problems-Part-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Probabilistic Prediction Problems - Part 1" /><published>2021-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/probability/2021/05/31/Probabilistic-Predicion-Problems-Part-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="probability" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part one deals with why parameters (or latent variables) are problematic and common loss functions for comparing two probability distributions.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Economics of Open Source</title><link href="https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/2021/05/31/Economics-of-Open-Source.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Economics of Open Source" /><published>2021-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/2021/05/31/Economics-of-Open-Source</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why does open-source work?]]></summary></entry></feed>
