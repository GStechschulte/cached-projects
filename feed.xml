The approximate distribution should be *as close as possible to the true posterior. This closeness is measured using KL-Divergence. If we have the joint $p(x, z)$ where $x$ is some observed data, the goal is to perform inference: given what we have observed, what can we infer about the latent states?, i.e , we want the posterior.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One is a Crowd</title><link href="https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/probability/reading/2022/06/21/Judgements-Probability.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One is a Crowd" /><published>2022-06-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/probability/reading/2022/06/21/Judgements-Probability</id><author><name></name></author><category term="probability" /><category term="reading" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the book, Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgement, the authors point out a study conducted by Edward Val and Harold Pashler in which the subjects answer a question, and then subsequently, are asked to answer the same question again. The subjects did not know they would have to answer the question twice. Val and Pashler’s hypothesis was that the average of the two answers would be more accurate than either of the two answers on their own. The researchers who conducted the study drew inspiration from the wisdom of the crowds effect—averaging independent judgements of different people generally improves accuracy.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Probabilistic Prediction Problems - Part 1</title><link href="https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/probability/2022/05/31/Probabilistic-Predicion-Problems-Part-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Probabilistic Prediction Problems - Part 1" /><published>2022-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://gstechschulte.github.io/cached-projects/probability/2022/05/31/Probabilistic-Predicion-Problems-Part-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="probability" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part one is a collection of notes on the problems with probabilistic predictions.]]></summary></entry></feed>
