In the book, _Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgement_, the authors point out a study conducted by Edward Val and Harold Pashler in which the subjects answer a question, and then subsequently, are asked to answer the same question again. The subjects did not know they would have to answer the question twice. Val and Pashler's hypothesis was that the average of the two answers would be more accurate than either of the two answers on their own. The researchers who conducted the study drew inspiration from the _wisdom of the crowds_ effectâ€”averaging independent judgements of different people generally improves accuracy.

We do not always produce identical judgements when faced with the same facts on different occasions.
