title: Probabilistic Prediction Problems
---

I have been wanting to organize my notes on _probabilistic prediction problems_
into a more structured and "high level" format. This post is a result of
this, and the notes are primarily from Probabilistic Machine Learning 
(Introduction and Advanced) by Kevin Murphy, Statistical Rethinking by 
Richard McElreath, and Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python.
